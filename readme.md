# Module 1 Individual Coding Task

This coding task is based on Problem 18 from Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/problem=18).

Solving the problem itself is not the task â€” loading in the data necessary to then solve the problem is
what you are tasked with for this task.

## The Purpose:
- To ensure that you have learned the basics of using git and GitHub to be able to contribute to your team.
- To practice reading in data from an outside source and creating objects to represent that data.

## The Task:

- [X] Fork this repo and clone a local copy to work in.

- [X] Read the provided `NumberTriange.java` file to understand the definition of a number triangle and what
      methods and variables we have defined to represent the structure.

- [X] Implement the static method for loading a number triangle from a file.
  - Create an issue for this in your repo, write your code on a branch, make a PR once finished, and merge your PR. 

- [X] Implement the retrieve method.
  - Create an issue for this in your repo, write your code on a branch, make a PR once finished, and merge your PR.

## Requirements:

- Submit the GitHub URL of your repo on MarkUs and ensure the self tests all pass to earn full credit.

- Your repo must contain at least:
  - ONE closed issue
  - ONE closed PR
  - exactly ONE commit author (other than the course team)
  - at least TWO commits by you (e.g., make one commit for each file you complete)
